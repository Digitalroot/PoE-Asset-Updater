## Usage

Download the CLI tool and run it using the following command:  
`PoEAssetUpdater <path-to-Content.ggpk> <asset-output-directory>`

## Development

The project is written in C# and outputs an executable CLI.

You'll need Visual Studio or VSCode and .NET Framework v4.8,
which you can get [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework).
Get the Developer Pack, not the Runtime.

Note: We should port this from .NET Framework to .NET Core for better multiplatform support. (libggpk needs to be ported first.)

**Run tests**

```powershell
> dotnet test
```

**Compile the app**

```powershell
> dotnet build
```

Check `bin\` for binaries.

**Run the app**

```powershell
> mkdir output
> PoEAssetUpdater.exe G:\PoE\Content.ggpk output
